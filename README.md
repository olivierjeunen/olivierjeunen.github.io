I'm a PhD student at the University of Antwerp in Belgium.  
My research interests revolve around data mining and machine learning, specifically with applications in information retrieval and recommender systems.
Within these fields, I enjoy working on a broad range of topics from core algorithms to evaluation.
I particularly enjoy working at the intersection of theory and application.

When obtaining my Master degree, I was lucky to have research collaborations and internships with Technicolor and University of Antwerp spin-off Predicube.  
Summer of 2019, during my PhD studies, I interned with Criteo's _causal recommendations_ team in Paris.
This experience has spiked my interest in applications of causal and counterfactual inference in recommendation settings.

I'm very open to collaborations, so if this interests you as well, send me an e-mail!
