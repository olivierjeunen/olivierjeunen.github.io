I'm a final-year PhD student at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/) in Belgium, working in the [Adrem Data Lab](http://adrem.uantwerpen.be/) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Bart Goethals](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/bart-goethals/).
My research interests revolve around _machine learning_, specifically its applications in _information retrieval_ and _recommender systems_.

Recently, Iâ€™ve focused on approaches that view the recommendation problem through the lens of bandit (or reinforcement) learning.

I enjoy working on a mix of theory and application, and have been lucky to collaborative with various industrial research laboratories.

Summer of 2021, I'm interning at [Spotify Research](https://research.atspotify.com/) to combine my passions for machine learning, causal inference, recommender systems and music.

Always open to collaborations so if this interests you, feel free to send me an e-mail!
