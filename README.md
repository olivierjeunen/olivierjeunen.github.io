I'm an incoming Postdoctoral Scientist at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) in Edinburgh, working in the [Performance Advertising](https://advertising.amazon.com/en-gb/solutions/objectives/performance-advertising) team.
I will defend my PhD dissertation at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/) in Belgium, where I work in the [Adrem Data Lab](http://adrem.uantwerpen.be/) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Bart Goethals](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/bart-goethals/).
My research interests revolve around _machine learning_, specifically its applications in _information retrieval_ and _recommender systems_.
Recently, Iâ€™ve focused on approaches that view the recommendation problem through the lens of bandit (or reinforcement) learning, borrowing ideas from _counterfactual_ and _causal inference_.  

I enjoy working on a synthesis of theory and application, and have been lucky to collaborative with various industrial research laboratories, including [Spotify Research](https://research.atspotify.com/), [Facebook](https://research.fb.com/), [Criteo](https://ailab.criteo.com/), [Technicolor](https://www.technicolor.com/), and several University of Antwerp spin-offs.
