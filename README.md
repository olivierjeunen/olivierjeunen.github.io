I'm a final-year PhD student at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/) in Belgium, working in the [Adrem Data Lab](http://adrem.uantwerpen.be/) under supervision of [Prof. Dr. Bart Goethals](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/bart-goethals/).
My research interests revolve around machine learning, specifically its applications in information retrieval and recommender systems.
Within this subfield, my work has ranged from core algorithms and scalability to evaluation.
More recently, I’ve been interested in approaches that view the recommendation problem through the lens of bandit (or reinforcement) learning.

Throughout my Master’s and PhD studies, I have been lucky to get the opportunity to collaborate with various industrial research laboratories.
This started out with applying machine learning techniques to network and Internet of Things (IoT) data at [Technicolor](https://www.technicolor.com/) in 2015; since then I have done research at two University of Antwerp spin-offs [Predicube](https://www.predicube.com/) and [Froomle](https://www.froomle.ai/), and more recently interned with the [Criteo AI Lab](https://ailab.criteo.com/) and [Facebook](https://research.fb.com/).

Always open to collaborations so if this interests you, feel free to send me an e-mail!
