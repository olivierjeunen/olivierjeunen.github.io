I'm a Principal Research Scientist at [Aampe](https://www.aampe.com/) working from Belgium.
My research revolves around machine learning applications to a broad set of problems, focused on recommendation, experimentation and evaluation.

My work tries to synthesise theory and application, and I have been lucky to collaborate with various industrial research laboratories throughout my career, including [ShareChat](https://sharechat.com/team/data-science) , [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/), [Spotify Research](https://research.atspotify.com/), [Facebook](https://research.fb.com/), [Criteo](https://ailab.criteo.com/), [Technicolor](https://www.technicolor.com/), and multiple University of Antwerp spin-offs.

My PhD dissertation was titled ["Offline Approaches to Recommendation with Online Success"](http://adrem.uantwerpen.be/bibrem/pubs/Jeunen2021PhDThesis.pdf), defended under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Bart Goethals](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/bart-goethals/) at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/).
My research interests include _machine learning_, specifically applying ideas from _causal_ and _counterfactual inference_ to _information retrieval_ and _recommender systems_.
