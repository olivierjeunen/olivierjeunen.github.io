I'm a Postdoctoral Scientist at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) in Edinburgh, working on machine learning applications to computational advertising.
I obtained my PhD at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/) in Belgium, where I worked in the [Adrem Data Lab](http://adrem.uantwerpen.be/) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Bart Goethals](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/bart-goethals/).
My dissertation was titled ["Offline Approaches to Recommendation with Online Success"](http://adrem.uantwerpen.be/bibrem/pubs/Jeunen2021PhDThesis.pdf).
Generally, my research interests revolve around _machine learning_, specifically its applications in _information retrieval_ and _recommender systems_.
Recently, Iâ€™ve focused on approaches that view the recommendation problem through the lens of bandit (or reinforcement) learning, borrowing ideas from _counterfactual_ and _causal inference_.  

I enjoy working on a synthesis of theory and application, and have been lucky to collaborative with various industrial research laboratories aside from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/), including [Spotify Research](https://research.atspotify.com/), [Facebook](https://research.fb.com/), [Criteo](https://ailab.criteo.com/), [Technicolor](https://www.technicolor.com/), and several University of Antwerp spin-offs.
